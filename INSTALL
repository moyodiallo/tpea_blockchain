This project requires opam 2.0 to be installed via opam, which is the
recommended way. 

The minimal Ocaml version is 4.08.0

* Install Opam 2
https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html

* Initialise Opam
If you never had initialised opam, do 
=opam init=

=eval $(opam env)=

* Install Scrabblos

First pin the git repository for the scrabblos project:

=opam pin add scrabblos https://gitlab.com/julien.t/projet-p6.git=

Then install the package:

=opam install scrabblos=

If your current opam switch has a too old version of the ocaml
compiler, and you don't want to create a new switch, you can use :

=opam install scrabblos --unlock-base=

Be aware that it will change the compiler version of your current
switch.


* Run
Once scrabblos is installed, you can run the server with 

=scrabblos-server=

to list the options you can use 
=scrabblos-server --help=

There is also a proxy, that print all eschanged messages between the
a client and the server. 
=scrabblos-proxy=

The server must have been launched with 
=scrabblos-server -port 12346=, the proxy will connect to the server
to the port 12346 and will listen on port 12345.
It can handle only one client for now.
